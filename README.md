## Abstract

This project aims to develop a brain-computer interface (BCI) system based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals to classify brain activity related to motor imagery tasks.

## Objectives

* **Data Preprocessing**: Develop and implement algorithms to clean and preprocess EEG signals.
* **Feature Extraction**: Design and extract meaningful features from pre-processed EEG signals.
* **Classification**: Develop and train machine learning models to classify EEG signals into different brain activity categories.
* **BCI Development**: Design and develop a BCI system that integrates the classification model with a user interface.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

* Apply filters, amplify and rectify EEG signals, and remove eye movement and muscle artifacts.

### Feature Extraction

* Extract time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency features.

### Classification

* Train machine learning models using SVM, Random Forest, and CNNs.

### BCI Development

* Design a user interface and integrate the classification model.

## Expected Outcomes

* **Accurate Classification**: Achieve high accuracy in classifying EEG signals.
* **Robust BCI System**: Develop a BCI system that accurately detects and classifies brain signals.
* **Improved Understanding**: Gain insights into neural mechanisms underlying motor imagery tasks.

## Key Features and Formulas

* **Mean**, **Variance**, **Skewness**, **Kurtosis**
* **Spectral Power**, **Peak Frequency**
* **Wavelet Coefficients**, **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)**
